To implement the De Bruijn algorithm, you would typically need to create the following classes:

DeBruijnGraph: This class represents the De Bruijn graph data structure. It will contain methods for adding edges, removing edges, and other graph-related operations. The De Bruijn graph is usually represented using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
SequenceGenerator: This class is responsible for generating sequences of k-mers from input DNA sequences or reads. It may have methods for reading input sequences from files, extracting k-mers, and generating k-mer sequences.
DeBruijnAssembler: This class is the main assembler that implements the De Bruijn algorithm. It will use the DeBruijnGraph and SequenceGenerator classes to construct the De Bruijn graph from input sequences, resolve overlaps between k-mers, and reconstruct the original DNA sequences or contigs.
Sequence: This class represents a DNA sequence or read. It may contain methods for manipulating DNA sequences, such as reverse complementation, trimming, and comparing sequences.
Contig: This class represents a contiguous sequence of DNA bases assembled from overlapping k-mers. It may have methods for calculating properties of contigs, such as length, coverage, and GC content.
AssemblerOptions: This class holds options and parameters for the assembler, such as k-mer length, minimum overlap size, and other algorithmic parameters. It allows users to configure the behavior of the assembler.
FileReader/FileWriter: These classes handle input and output operations, such as reading input sequences from FASTA files and writing assembled contigs to output files.
By implementing these classes, you can create a modular and extensible De Bruijn assembler that separates concerns and promotes code reuse. Each class encapsulates specific functionality related to its domain, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
